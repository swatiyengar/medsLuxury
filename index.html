                            <br> As of 2021, Zolgensma (*onasemnogene abeparvovec*) is the most expensive drug in the United States.<sup>1</sup> It is a $2.1 million dollar gene therapy treatment for children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) - childhood
                            disorder that causes muscular erosion that can lead to lung infections and muscle weakness.
                            <br>
                            <br> 1 in 50 (6.6 million) Americans are genetic carriers of SMA and don't know it.<sup>2</sup> The disease affects 1 in 10,000 babies born each year and is the leading inherited cause of infant death.<sup>3</sup> Approximately,
                            95% of children diagnosed with SMA (Type 1) won't live to see their second birthday.<sup>4</sup>
                            <br>
                            <br> Children who have been treated with Zolgensma are effectively cured of SMA; however, neither insurers nor patients can afford its price tag. AveXis (a Novartis subsidiary) offers insurers an annual payment plan of $425,000
                            over 5 years to pay for treatment. Some payers in the United States have considered a "performance-based annuity" model in which an initial payment is made upon delivery of the therapy and all subsequent payments are dependent
                            on treatment outcomes.<sup>5</sup> As regulations differ by state, there is no guarantee that patients will have the flexibility to move between states or even insurers and still have continued coverage.

                            <br> Zokinvy (*lonafarnib*) is the second most expensive drug in the United States.<sup>1</sup> It is the first treatment approved for Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), also known as the 'Benjamin Button' disease.
                            HGPS is a rare, fatal genetic disorder causing rapid, premature aging beginning in childhood and affect 1 in 4 million newborns worldwide.<sup>2</sup>

                            <br> Zokinvy is a daily treatment which can extend the life of patient with HGPS by 2.5 years, as well as reduce or delay the effects of the disease.<sup>3</sup> Patients might typically expect to pay $86,040 a month for treatment.<sup>1</sup>                            Eiger Pharmaceuticals established 'Eiger OneCare' to provide personalized suport, including reimbursement expertise and copay assistance, to assist patients seeking access to Zokinvy.<sup>4</sup>; however, the level of coverage
                            and reimbursement ultimately varies by insurers in the United States.

                            <br> Danyelza (*naxitamab-gqgk*) is the third most expensive drug in the United States.<sup>1</sup> Danyelza is a monoclonal antibody used in combination with other chemotherapies for the treatment of relapsed or refractory
                            high-risk neuroblastoma in children and adults. Neuroblastoma is a rare cancer that develops in the nerve tissues of the adrenal gland, neck, chest, or spinal cord.<sup>2</sup> However, 700-800 new cases are diagnosed each
                            year in the United States, with 90% of cases found in children younger than 5 years old.<sup>3</sup>
                            <br>
                            <br> Danyelza was initially approved under the FDA's accelerated approval program, which which provides earlier patient access for new drugs while manufacturers continue to conduct clinical trials to confirm efficacy and clinical
                            benefit. Early trials noted that 30-45% of Danyelza patients experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their cancer.<sup>4</sup>
                            <br>
                            <br> A single vial of Danyelza costs $20,368, and patients may require approximately 48 vials per year, in addition to other complementary chemotherapy treatments.<sup>1</sup> Danyelza's manufacturer, Y-mAbs, created Y-mAbs
                            Connect, an access program to help patients navigate insurance, as well as provide treatment to eligible uninsured patients at reduced- or no-cost.<sup>5</sup> Y-mAbs evaluates each patient access request on a case-by-case
                            basis, but does not guarantee that coverage will be granted.<sup>6</sup>

                            <br> Myalept (*metreleptin*) is the fourth most expensive drug in the United States<sup>1</sup> It is used to treat leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired lipodystrophy, a rare condition that results in having

                            pharmacies enrolled in the Myalept Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program.<sup>4</sup>

                            <br> Aegerion Pharmaceuticals offers the ByMySide Copay Program, which might help some eligible patients cover 100% of copayment or co-insurance costs. However, the program is not valid for prescriptions eligible to be reimbursed,
                            in whole or in part, by state or federally funded healthcare programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, Tricare, VA/DOD, or any state prescription drug assistance programs. As is common with other types of patient assistance programs,
                            the manufacturer reserves the right to discontinue or modify the copay program at any time.<sup>5</sup>

                            <br> Luxturna has widely been described as potential cure to this rare disease, at the cost of $425,000 per eye. It's manufacturer, Spark Therapeutics, provides assistance to patients by helping them navigate insurance coverage
                            and connecting them to other financial resources.<sup>4</sup> Some payers in the United States have considered different payment schemes to allow patient access, such an "outcomes-based pricing" model in the manufactuer must
                            pay rebates to the insurer if a patient's vision does not meet outcome thresholds within a certain period after treatment.<sup>5</sup> Critics argue that the list price for Luxturna is unfounded, as much of its research, development,
                            and trial costs were borne by the US Government.
