                        <br> As of 2021, Zolgensma (*onasemnogene abeparvovec*) is the most expensive drug in the United States. It is a $2.1 million dollar gene therapy treatment for children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) - childhood disorder that
                        causes muscular erosion that can lead to lung infections and muscle weakness.
                        <br>
                        <br> 1 in 50 (6.6 million) Americans are genetic carriers of SMA and don't know it. The disease affects 1 in 11,000 babies born each year. The odds of a child being born with SMA are higher than the odds of being struck by lightning
                        (1 in 500,000). Approximately, 95% of children diagnosed with SMA (Type 1) won't live to see their second birthday.
                        <br> <br>Children who have been treated with Zolgensma are effectively cured of SMA; however, neither insurers nor patients can afford its price tag. AveXis (a Novartis subsidiary) offers insurers an annual payment plan of $425,000
                        over 5 years to pay for treatment. Some payers in the United States have considered a "performance-based annuity" model in which an initial payment is made upon delivery of the therapy and all subsequent payments are dependent
                        on treatment outcomes. As regulations differ by state, there is no guarantee that patients will the the flexibility to move between states or even insurers and still have continued coverage.
