                As of 2021, Zolgensma is the most expensive drug in the United States. It is a $2.1 million dollar gene therapy treatment for children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) - childhood disorder that causes muscular erosion that can lead to lung infections
                and muscle weakness. 1 in 50 (6.6 million) Americans are genetic carriers of SMA and don't know it. The disease affects 1 in 11,000 babies born each year. The odds of a child being born with SMA are higher than the odds of being struck
                by lightning (1 in 500,000). Children who have been treated with Zolgensma are effectively cured of SMA; however, neither insurers nor patients can afford its price tag. AveXis (a Novartis subsidiary) offers insurers an annual payment
                plan of $425,000 over 5 years to pay for treatment.
